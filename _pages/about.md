Welcome to my personal website!

I am the Chief U.S. Macro Strategist for TD Securities. Based in NYC, I head the firm's U.S. economics research and lead its efforts to map U.S. and global research outputs into implications for the U.S. and global economies and markets.  

Before taking up my current position, I was an Economic Research Advisor in the Research Group at the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research). There I was the lead advisor on modelling developments in global financial markets and of global drivers of U.S. inflation and economic growth, and as part of this I developed and head the production of the [Global Supply Chain Pressure Index](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi) and the [Oil Price Dynamics Report](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/oil_price_dynamics_report). I also contributed to policy debates and advised senior management of the New York Fed. Earlier in my tenure at the NY Fed, I was head of the U.S. trade forecast and was part of the model-based nowcasting team focussing on U.S. inflation and growth forecasting.

Prior to joining the New York Fed, I held a number of senior economist positions at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/), was a Research Fellow at the [De Nederlandsche Bank/Dutch Central Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/en/) and was a member of the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics). I also have been a visiting scholar and consultant at several foreign research and policy institutions, such as the [Bank of Japan](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/), [De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/en/), the [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics) and the [School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sef/).

I regularly produce analytical posts that cover topical financial market and macroeconomic issues, both for the U.S. and globally, with an aim to contribute to the public policy debate. My academic research has been published in high ranking academic journals and covers topics such as macroecconomic forecasting and econometric modeling, global macroeconomics and finance, and empirical exchange rate modeling. I also was a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en) and the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/about-tinbergen-institute/).
